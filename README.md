Design Notes

- Make codeboxes prettier
- Make top level text fields full horizontal headers
- Make intermediate text fields multi-column
- Make Subheader node

- Choose a different name for Raw Node. Something indistinguishable.
- Clean up CSS in the node classes or you're going to lose your fucking mind.

- Don't allow newlines following a code blcok
- Refactor CSS names for nodes. Make sure they're consistent, otherwise things are going to get fucked.
- Styling for base box in WHITE
- Play with colums
- Decide about rendering levels.
- Arrow up/down
- Delete when empty
- shift + delete
- Collapses

- Backend
- Newline persistence management

Deferred

- Undo system

BUGS

- Editting text then clicking away changes where that text ends up in a bad way
- Hitting enter while on a code block should make a comment block
