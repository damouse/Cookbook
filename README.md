Design Notes

- Play with colums

- Make intermediate text fields multi-column
- Don't allow newlines following a code blcok
- Decide about rendering levels.
- Arrow up/down
- Delete when empty
- shift + delete
- Collapses

- Backend
- Newline persistence management

Deferred

- Undo system

BUGS

- Mess with CSS for nodes and spacing (again)
- Editting text then clicking away changes where that text ends up in a bad way
- Hitting enter while on a code block should make a comment block
