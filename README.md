TODO

- Down arrow
- Review up arrow
- Understand cursor position-- need to know when we can delete and move to the
  next line and arrows and all that jazz
- Code button, and review button position
- Delete when empty
- shift + delete

- Service/DI Review

- Menu review: add better buttons

  - Collapse/Expand All

- Make intermediate text fields multi-column

Deferred

- More testing with columns
- Persistance
- Newline persistence management
- Backend
- Undo system

BUGS

- Mess with CSS for nodes and spacing (again)
- Editting text then clicking away changes where that text ends up in a bad way
- Hitting enter while on a code block should make a comment block
