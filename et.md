10 days to 14 days
3-5 days in Romania

Other countries worth seeing
- Italy 
- France

Maybes
- Germany
- Turkey
- Greece? 
- Day in Amsterdam?
- Prague? 
- Belgium? 

Of these, italy is the most interesting, but it overlaps with post-TML travel next year.

How many could we hit in one go? 
5-11 days remaining after Romania
1-3 other countries, 2-3 days apiece. 
 
Hypothetical Trip
- 3 days Romania
- 2 days Prague 
- 2 days Rome
- 2 days deep italy
- 2 days paris
- 1 day Amsterdam

That's a lot of train/airfare.
